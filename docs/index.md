## Customizing Content

### Adding Projects

Projects are stored as MDX files in the `content/projects/` directory. Each project file contains frontmatter metadata and MDX content. See the "Adding New Projects" section for details.

### Customizing Components

The template uses a component-driven approach with reusable components in the `src/components/` directory. You can customize these components to change the static content, styling, or behavior of the site.

## Deployment

The template can be deployed to any hosting platform that supports Next.js, such as Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. See the "Deployment" section for detailed instructions.
